# Raw Food Forest

This is the German website for a permaculture project in Isan, Thailand.

#### Short link

You can use this link to quickly access the website: https://bit.ly/rawfoodforest

Because the Github docs link is very long by itself, we use a URL shortening service.

## Compilation

[PugJS](https://pugjs.org) is used to compile the `.pug` files which output to HTML files.

The HTML files are also uploaded to make use of GitHub Pages.

## Attributions

The font in the top logo is Gabriola.

The vector icons in the footer are all from www.materialdesignicons.com

#### Open Source and Permaculture

We feel those principles have to go hand-in-hand, so we strive to create everything as
open source as possible.

'Hosting' the website on GitHub Pages is a way for us to save money on web-hosting solutions.

#### Similarity to https://github.com/Gira-X/naturquelle-lapalma-homepage

Both permaculture projects have the same owners, so both homepages are very similar in content and philosophy.
